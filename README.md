# Polygen

The original author is Alvise SpanÃ²


This was   **N O T**   written by me, I just downloaded the source code from
[here](https://polygen.org/it/casa) and ported it to OCaml 5.3.0

Also, I know nothing about OCaml. The porting was done by just pure
guess-working and Google searches.

## Description

This program can generate strings given a type-2 grammar.
In the `grm` directory there are examples; all of these are
parodying habits, stereotypes and trends (of Italy in the 2000s).

The grammar meta-language are written in a slightly more expressive version of
EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form).
Refer to the manuals in the `manual` directory (currently only the Italian
version is available) or to the `Quick grammar description` below.

## Usage

`polygen` -> will print an help message

`polygen <grammar file>` -> will generate a grammar starting from the `S`
non-terminal symbol

`polygen -S <SYM> <grammar file>` -> will generate a grammar starting from the
`<SYM>` non-terminal symbol

## Quick grammar description

Terminal symbols are any contiguous (i.e. without any spaces between) sequence
of characters starting with a lower case letter or any sequence of characters
enclosed by double quotes.

Non-terminal symbols are any contiguous sequence of characters starting with a
upper case letter.

The `::=` operator is defines the production for the non-terminal symbol in the
left-hand side (denoted with LHS in short).

The pipe character (`|`) is separating the definition of the production rule in
the right-hand side (denoted with RHS in short).

You can "save" the definition of a non-terminal symbol by using the `:=`
operator; you have to enclose the whole definition in round brackets.

A sequence of two (or more) symbols (either terminal or non-terminal) are
separated by space. Using the caret (`^`) operator it will remove the space.

The underscore (`_`) character represents an epsilon production. Basically it
is an empty string.

You can use the backslack (`\`) character to escape the following characters
(it means that you remove the semantics associated with the following character
and it will be printed as it is)

A production rule MUST end with a semicolon (`;`)

### Example 1:
    S ::= Name VerbObject;
    Name ::= "John" | "Richard" | "STOCAZZO";
    Verb ::= "eats" Eatable | "drinks" Drinkable | "goes" Place;
    Eatable ::= "an apple" | "a whole watermelon";
    Drinkable ::= "a glass of water";
    Place ::= "to Fanculo" | "in the Wisconsin";

### Example 2:
    S ::= (N := Name; N says "\"hello\"." N goes to the bathroom);
    Name ::= "John" | "Richard" | "STOCAZZO";
